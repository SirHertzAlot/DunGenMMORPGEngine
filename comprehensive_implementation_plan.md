## 1. Define Your Goals

**How we came to these goals:**
Our overarching aim is to create a highly deterministic, server-authoritative, data-driven MMORPG engine inspired by DnD’s deep simulation, using Unity DOTS and an extensible procedural generation pipeline. Our rationale is driven by contemporary MMO production realities (the need for scale and world longevity), the benefits of ECS for performance/modularity, and the lessons learned from successful industry implementations (Tencent, Supercell, etc.).

**Core Goals:**

- **Centralize authoritative state in ScyllaDB:** Horizontal scalability, high throughput, sharding support.
- **Low-latency gameplay with per-server Redis cache:** Keeps “hot” state closest to simulation, avoids DB bottlenecks.
- **Procedural Generator Pipeline (PGP) as modular microservices:** Enables dynamic content, designer self-service, and pipeline extensibility.
- **Game logic as headless Unity servers:** Deterministic, ECS-driven simulation, leveraging Unity’s DOTS and Havok.
- **Extensive data-driven configuration (YAML/JSON → FlatBuffers/Protobuf):** Empowers designers/modders and ensures replay/debug capability.
- **Scalable, audit-friendly orchestration with containerization/Kubernetes:** Enables fault tolerance, updating, and region sharding.
- **Maximize flexibility through WASM/Lua extension points:** Future-proofs the stack for hot-swappable logic and secure modding.

**Success Metrics:**

- >100K game-state operations/sec/node through the backend[^1].
- <50ms round-trip simulation tick for online gameplay.
- 99.99% uptime with rolling upgrades, deployment safety.
- Designer time from config tweak to live test: <1h.
- Deterministically replayable logs for every event and mutation.


## 2. Map Out the Project Scope

**How the scope was determined:**
Drawing on the exhaustive breakdown in `implementation_plan.md`, practical data-flow constraints, and the requirements of procedural MMO game simulation, the scope is modularized for technical clarity and maximal designer empowerment.

**Key Elements:**

- **Persistent storage:** ScyllaDB (sharded, region-aware), with all authoritative game and world state.
- **Hot state caching:** Per-server Redis, avoiding cross-server caching and complex cache coherency.
- **Procedural Generation:** Modular PGP cluster, each generator/pipeline step as its own service or WASM module, orchestrated by a state machine or message bus.
- **Game logic:** Unity DOTS headless servers, leveraging ECS and determinism; stateless clients.
- **Transformation pipeline:** YAML/JSON-defined, supporting in-place enrichment and constraint-driven entity generation.
- **Integration:** gRPC and FlatBuffers/Protobuf for all inter-domain messages, to minimize serialization drag and ease Unity integration.
- **Operational stack:** Docker/Kubernetes for containerization; Prometheus/Grafana and ELK for observeability.
- **Testing/QA:** Comprehensive validation and logging integrated at every data touchpoint, with replayable state traces.
- **Extension/Modding:** All content, rules, and transformation steps are externally defined (not hardcoded), supporting rapid iteration.


## 3. Identify Key Stakeholders and Assign Roles

**Rationale:**
In complex, modular architectures, clearly mapped accountability is crucial for both technical velocity and maintenance. The design mirrors proven MMO and live-service backend models.

**Stakeholders/Roles:**

- **Backend Engineers:** Orchestrate DB layer (ScyllaDB), Redis cache setup, PGP microservices, infrastructure/DevOps.
- **Game Logic/Simulation Team:** Unity DOTS development, ECS component and system authorship, deterministic event simulation.
- **Procedural Designers:** Define YAML/JSON templates and transformation pipeline configs, create/curate new content, validate via tool-driven feedback.
- **DevOps/SRE:** Maintain container clusters, monitor health, manage scaling and deployments.
- **QA \& Validation Engineers:** Build automated pipelines for validation, replay, log analysis, and continuous integration checks.
- **Modders/Community:** In the long run, external contributors add content via templates/configs.


## 4. Set a Realistic Timeline with Milestones and Resources

**Why this breakdown?**
The timeline reflects the logical dependency graph found in your plan: infrastructure comes before simulation, which comes before pipeline enrichment, and everything rides on CI/CD and strong validation practices.


| Phase | Key Deliverables | Length |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **Foundational Infrastructure** | Stand up K8s, Docker images, ScyllaDB/Redis nodes | 2-4 weeks |
| **Simulation \& Engine Core** | Unity DOTS game loop, ECS, deterministic RNG | 3-5 weeks |
| **PGP/Transformation Pipeline** | Modular pipeline steps, WASM/Lua extension hooks | 4-6 weeks |
| **Integration \& API Layer** | gRPC APIs, FlatBuffer schemas, orchestration glue | 2-3 weeks |
| **Content \& Designer Workflow** | Config template validation, editor tools, modding | 2-3 weeks |
| **Testing, Logging, Monitoring** | Full trace logs, replay, CI/CD, metrics, alerting | 3-4 weeks |
| **Launch and Iterative Polish** | Load tests, region sharding, UX/test feedback | 2-4 weeks |

> Note: Each phase is parallelized where possible (e.g., QA/validation begins as soon as phase 2).

## 5. Anticipate Risks and Create Mitigation Strategies

**How risks were identified:**
Based on hard technical experience with distributed MMOs and as documented in your implementation plan, critical failure points often emerge from data/model drift, pipeline module errors, and infra/DB scaling.


| Risk | Reasoning \& Data from Plan | Mitigation Approach |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **Config/Template Drift** | Extensible YAML/JSON configs/regression in modules | Strong schema validation, CI/CD checks, versioned config files, PR review gates |
| **Transformation Bugs** | Complex, nontrivial WASM modules \& pipeline steps | Hot-reload with rollback, sandboxing, rapid testing in non-prod cluster |
| **Persistent Data Scaling** | Region sharding, player surge, world events | Horizontal sharding, K8s auto-scaling, region isolation, backup/restore policies |
| **Cache/DB Consistency** | Write-after-read or invalidation bugs | Cache-aside, write-through strategies, unit tests for state flow |
| **Performance Degradation** | Slow queries or content generation loops | Observability, flame-graph profiling, auto-scaling triggers |
| **Downtime During Updates** | Rolling changes, update failures | Blue-green deployments, health checks, staged rollout |
| **Modding Security Holes** | Designer/extensible logic introduces vulnerabilities | WASM sandboxing, log/alert on module errors, strict signature validation |

## 6. Monitor Progress and Adjust as Needed

**Why this matters and how it’s planned:**
A modular stack is only as strong as its observability. As in top-tier game backends, metrics, alerting, and fast feedback cycles are essential for rapid innovation and safe extension.

**Monitoring \& QA Details:**

- **Prometheus/Grafana:** Real-time tracking of server, cache, and orchestration clusters.
- **Structured logs:** Every major event, transformation, and state transition is logged, enabling deterministic replay and automatic anomaly detection.
- **Continuous validation:** Every template/config change triggers schema validation and simulation dry-run.
- **Alerting:** Metrics and errors are piped to on-call dashboards and incident queues.
- **Live benchmarking:** Synthetic load is injected regularly to track impact of new pipeline modules or server code.
