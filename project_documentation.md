## 3. System Architecture

### 3.1 Architectural Patterns

### Domain-Driven, Modular, Data-Driven, Event-Driven

1. **ECS/DOTS Pattern**
   - All gameplay logic is modeled as **entities** with **components** processed by **systems**
   - Promotes modularity, scalability, and parallelism
2. **Server-Authoritative & Deterministic**
   - All logic and state management is on the server; clients are strictly consumers
   - Seed-based RNG, fixed timestep, atomic transactions for simulation determinism
3. **Data-Driven & Configurable**
   - Game rules, content, and behaviors are defined externally (YAML/JSON)
   - Modular transformation pipeline allows for easy extension of post-processing/enrichment steps
4. **Event-Driven Architecture**
   - All state changes and gameplay actions propagate as explicit, traceable events on a global event bus
   - Inter-system hooks connect subsystems (economy, ranking, quest, social)
5. **Immutability-in-Transit**
   - All state sent to clients is immutable and validated
   - Supports safe rollback/replay and ensures consistency
6. **Comprehensive Logging & Validation**
   - Every meaningful action and transformation is logged for replay, debugging, and analytics
   - Validation runs at every stage to guarantee world consistency

### 3.2 System Logic Flow

1. **Seed-Driven World Initialization**
   - The engine begins by generating world terrain, biomes, and climate using a deterministic seed
   - Guarantees reproducibility and consistent world state across sessions or server deployments
2. **Constraint-Based Entity Generation**
   - All non-terrain entities (NPCs, settlements, events, loot, etc.) are instantiated by resolving constraint sets
   - Constraints are defined in external configuration (YAML/JSON)
   - Algorithms such as Wave Function Collapse (WFC) ensure that generated entities meet all requirements
3. **Transformation Pipeline**
   - The pipeline applies a series of modular enrichment steps to the generated entities
   - Each step is defined as a transformation module
   - The pipeline is fully data-driven, allowing steps to be added, removed, or reordered
4. **Inter-System Hooks**
   - Event-driven hooks connect major systems (ranking, economy, quest, social, etc.)
   - Hooks are registered with the engine and triggered when certain events occur
5. **Validation & Logging**
   - After enrichment, all entities and world state are validated for internal consistency
   - Every transformation, enrichment, and hook-triggered change is logged

### 9.1 Configuration System

### Config File Structure

Located in `/config/`:

- `engine.yaml` â€” Global engine parameters
- `npc_base.yaml` â€” NPC archetypes
- `settlement_market.yaml` â€” Settlement templates
- `constraints.yaml` â€” Demographic, economic, social constraints
- `hooks.yaml` â€” Registered inter-system hooks

### Supported Fields & Parameters

Each template supports:

- `id`, `type`, `properties` (customizable fields)
- `constraints` (rules for generation and relationships)
- `enrichment_steps` (transformation modules to apply)
- `inherit` (base template to extend)

### 9.2 Generic Templating System

### Purpose

Provides flexible, reusable mechanism for defining entities, transformation steps, and content patterns in external configuration files.

### Key Concepts

**Templates:**

- Defined in YAML/JSON files
- Represent entity archetypes (NPC, settlement, item, quest, event, etc.)
- Include parameterized fields, constraints, and optional enrichment logic
- Support inheritance for specialized roles or variants

**Template Resolution:**

- Engine resolves templates by filling parameters based on constraints and world context
- Transformation pipeline reads templates to apply enrichment steps
- Supports role assignment, quest injection, and helper object spawning

**Extending Templates:**

- Developers and designers create new templates by adding configuration files
- Existing templates can be extended or overridden
- Transformation steps reference templates by type

### 9.3 Transformation Pipeline Extension

### Pipeline Configuration

```yaml
steps:
  - name: AssignRoles
    config: config/roles.yaml
  - name: EquipItems
    config: config/equipment.yaml
  - name: AssignEncounters
    config: config/encounters.yaml
```

### Adding New Steps

1. Implement enrichment logic in new class implementing `ITransformationStep`
2. Create corresponding YAML config for the step
3. Register step in `TransformationStepFactory`
4. Add step reference to pipeline YAML

### Modding Support

- Designers can add, edit, or remove YAML config files
- Steps can be re-ordered or replaced by changing pipeline YAML
- All steps log actions for replay/debugging

- Validate all external config before loading

### Common Pitfalls

- Never expose internal admin APIs to public
- Watch for template/config injection attacks
- Implement proper authentication and authorization

## 13. Modding & Designer Workflow

### 13.1 Designer Empowerment

### Content Creation Workflow

- Designers edit templates and constraints in `/config/`
- No code changes required for most content additions
- Use inheritance and parameterization for templates

### Supported Tools

- VS Code, JetBrains Rider, or any YAML/JSON editor
- Optional: Custom config validation scripts
- Real-time validation and error checking

### 13.2 Advanced Subsystems for Modding

### Combat Actions & Conditions

- Add/modify combat actions in `config/combat_actions.yaml`
- Define custom status effects and interactions

### AI/Behavior Profiles

- Define archetypes, motivations, and fears in `config/personalities.yaml`
- Behavioral state machines and decision trees

### Factions & Reputation

- Add factions and reputation logic in `config/factions.yaml`
- Dynamic relationship systems

### Quests & Story Hooks

- Templates in `config/quest_templates.yaml`
- Dynamic quest assignment and tracking

### Event/Trigger System

- Add triggers and effects in `config/event_triggers.yaml`
- World-changing events and consequences

### 13.3 Modding Guidelines

- Avoid direct code changes when possible
- Use inheritance and parameterization for templates
- All subsystems are data-driven and extensible
- Add new templates, archetypes, factions, quests with no code changes

## 15. Case Studies

### 15.1 WASM Pipeline Orchestration

### Region Pipeline Example: Town of Willowbrook

**Pipeline Steps** (executed as WASM modules):

1. **Terrain Generation**
   - Input: Seed, biome config
   - Output: Terrain mesh, biome map
2. **Constraint-Driven Generation**
   - Input: Town config (population, ratios, economic tiers)
   - Output: Raw citizen entities, shops, NPCs
3. **Transformation Pipeline**
   - Input: Entities + transformation configs
   - Output: Enriched NPCs (roles, items, relationships), unique locations
4. **Validation & Logging**
   - Input: Enriched objects
   - Output: Validated region state, transformation log

### Sample WASM Pipeline Orchestrator (Rust + Wasmtime)

### Sample WASM Pipeline Orchestrator (Rust + Wasmtime)

```rust
use wasmtime::{Engine, Module, Store, Instance, Func};
use serde_json::Value;

fn run_wasm_stage(wasm_bytes: &[u8], input_json: &Value) -> Value {
    let engine = Engine::default();
    let module = Module::new(&engine, wasm_bytes).unwrap();
    let mut store = Store::new(&engine, ());
    let instance = Instance::new(&mut store, &module, &[]).unwrap();

    // Assumes WASM module exports a "process" function
    let process: Func = instance.get_func(&mut store, "process").unwrap();
    let result_json = process.call(&mut store, &[input_json]).unwrap();
    serde_json::from_slice(result_json).unwrap()
}

// Example pipeline orchestration
fn main() {
    let terrain_wasm = std::fs::read("terrain_gen.wasm").unwrap();
    let constraint_wasm = std::fs::read("entity_gen.wasm").unwrap();
    let transform_wasm = std::fs::read("transform.wasm").unwrap();
    let validate_wasm = std::fs::read("validate.wasm").unwrap();

    let seed_config = json!({"seed": 12345, "biome": "temperate"});
    let terrain = run_wasm_stage(&terrain_wasm, &seed_config);

    let town_config = json!({
        "town": "Willowbrook",
        "population": 500,
        "demographics": {...}
    });
    let entities = run_wasm_stage(&constraint_wasm, &town_config);

    let transform_config = json!({"npc_rules": {...}, "item_tables": {...}});
    let enriched = run_wasm_stage(&transform_wasm, &entities);

    let validation = run_wasm_stage(&validate_wasm, &enriched);

    println!("Final region state: {:?}", validation);
}
```

### Transformation WASM Module Logic (Rust)

```rust
// This module is compiled to WASM and loaded by the orchestrator
#[no_mangle]
pub extern "C" fn process(input_ptr: *const u8, input_len: usize) -> *const u8 {
    let input = unsafe { std::slice::from_raw_parts(input_ptr, input_len) };
    let entities: Vec<Entity> = serde_json::from_slice(input).unwrap();

    let enriched = entities.into_iter().map(|mut e| {
        e.assign_role();
        e.equip_items();
        e.link_family();
        e.add_backstory();
        e
    }).collect::<Vec<_>>();

    let output = serde_json::to_vec(&enriched).unwrap();
    output.as_ptr()
}
```

### Key Advantages

- **Performance:** WASM modules run with near-native speed; pipeline can be parallelized per region
- **Modularity:** Each step is a WASM moduleâ€”hot-swappable and versioned for rapid iteration
- **Security:** WASM sandboxing prevents malicious or buggy code from corrupting world state
- **Designer/Modder Friendly:** Transformation pipeline rules and modules can be data-driven and extended
- **Auditability:** Full transformation and validation logs at every step
- **Scalability:** Easily scale by adding regions or parallel orchestrators

### 15.3 Database Selection & Integration Case Study

### Requirements Satisfaction

Our procedural MMO world requires a data architecture that supports:

- High-performance generation, transformation, and simulation
- Modular, extensible enrichment (transformation pipeline)
- Efficient and reliable storage/retrieval of world state and entities
- Scalable real-time operations for thousands of concurrent players
- Deep integration between C#, database, and backend logic

| Performance | Near-native, multi-language support    | Start-up overhead, debugging          |
| Security    | WASM sandboxing, resource limits       | Still maturing; must audit extensions |
| Flexibility | Run C#, Rust, Go, etc. in DB layer     | DB must support WASM extensions       |
| Integration | Deep logic in DB, unified dev workflow | Not all DBs support WASM yet          |
| Modularity  | Hot-swappable modules, versioning      | Dependency management, module loading |
