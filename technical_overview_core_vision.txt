DunGen MMORPG Engine: Detailed Briefing Document
Executive Summary

The DunGen MMORPG Engine is undergoing a systematic redevelopment to become a highly deterministic, server-authoritative, and data-driven game engine. Inspired by DnD mechanics, it leverages Unity’s DOTS (ECS, Jobs, Burst), Havok Physics, and advanced procedural content generation. The core philosophy emphasizes extensibility, modularity, and production-grade quality, with a strong focus on enabling designers and modders to inject content and logic via external configuration. A key innovation is the WASM-driven transformation pipeline, which allows for modular, hot-swappable enrichment of generated world content with near-native performance. The engine is designed for global scalability, supporting hundreds of thousands to millions of concurrent users through region-based sharding and a robust microservices infrastructure.
I. Engine Core Principles & Architecture

The DunGen Engine adheres to a strict set of core principles to ensure a robust, scalable, and maintainable foundation:
A. Core Principles

    Server-Authoritative: "All game logic and state management run on the server." Clients are "stateless" and "only handle prediction, rendering, and input, never authoritative logic."
    Deterministic: "All gameplay outcomes are deterministic, driven by seed-based RNG and fixed-timestep simulation." This is crucial for replayability and consistency, utilizing "Seeded RNG" and "Fixed-Point Math."
    Data-Driven: "All rules, content, and gameplay systems are defined externally and loaded at runtime." This allows designers and modders to inject content via "YAML/JSON" files.
    Event-Driven: "All state changes propagate as explicit, traceable events" on a "Global Event Bus," enabling "dynamic, responsive world simulation."
    ECS/DOTS: "All gameplay logic is implemented using Unity’s ECS for scalability/performance." This leverages Unity's "Data-Oriented Technology Stack."
    Immutability-in-Transit: "State sent to clients is immutable and validated," supporting "safe rollback/replay and ensuring consistency."
    Procedural-First: "All world, dungeon, and item content is procedurally generated."
    Comprehensive Logging & Atomic Transactions: "Deep, structured logs for every state transition and event," with "All state changes are atomic and validated."
    Extensibility: "All systems are generic, modular, and easily extended."

B. Architectural Pattern

The engine follows a Domain-Driven, Modular, Data-Driven, Event-Driven architectural pattern. This includes:

    ECS/DOTS: Gameplay logic modeled as "entities with components processed by systems."
    Server-Authoritative & Deterministic: Ensures consistency and security.
    Data-Driven & Configurable: Facilitates "rapid iteration, modding, and designer-friendliness."
    Event-Driven Architecture: Decouples systems and enables real-time reactions.
    Immutability-in-Transit: For consistent client state.
    Comprehensive Logging & Validation: "Every meaningful action and transformation is logged for replay, debugging, and analytics."

C. Technology Stack

    Core Engine: Unity (2022+) with DOTS (ECS, Jobs, Burst Compiler) and Havok Physics for "high-fidelity, deterministic simulation."
    Programming Language: C# (primary).
    Configuration & Modding: YAML/JSON for external definitions, and Unity ScriptableObjects for runtime configuration.
    Networking: Custom server-client sync for "efficient state synchronization," and a "Web API Layer" (ASP.NET or Unity Web Request) for leaderboard, stats, and events. gRPC is specifically mentioned for "fast, reliable streaming between server and Unity backend."
    Persistence: ScyllaDB/Cassandra with DataStax C# Driver for "persistent state, large-scale data, event logs," and Redis/Tarantool for "hot state" (in-memory DB).
    Tooling: Unity Editor Extensions, .NET Test Frameworks, and Structured Logging.
    WASM Integration: WebAssembly (WASM) modules are critical for "unifying backend logic and database layers," allowing C#, Rust, Go, etc., to run "directly inside or alongside any database that supports WASM plugins/extensions." Lua endpoints are "retained... for fast, atomic validation and cheat prevention."

II. Procedural Generation & Transformation Pipeline

The engine's procedural generation is a sophisticated, multi-phase workflow designed to create rich and immersive worlds.
A. Workflow Phases

    Terrain Generation (Seed-Driven): "World terrain, biomes, and climate are generated using a deterministic seed." This produces the foundational world map.
    Constraint-Driven Generation (Non-Terrain Content): "All non-terrain world entities (NPCs, towns, events, structures, loot, etc.) are generated by resolving constraint sets through WFC or similar algorithms." Constraints ensure "demographic ratios, economic tiers, profession distributions, social relationships." This output is "raw entities, minimally enriched."
    Transformation Pipeline (Post-Processing): This is the "heart of enrichment," applying "additional game objects, features, or relationships (e.g., assigning roles, equipping items, linking NPCs as family, adding backstories, assigning jobs/pets/quests)." It bridges technical output with "thematic, narrative, and gameplay focus." This pipeline is "fully data-driven and modular."
    Validation & Logging: Ensures "all enriched models are internally consistent and satisfy their extended constraints," logging "all transformation steps for replay, debugging, and analytics."

B. WASM Orchestration

A major technical deep dive focuses on WASM orchestration for the pipeline.

    "All Generation & Transformation Steps are orchestrated by a master WASM module (or, in a container architecture, by a state machine deployed as a service)."
    WASM modules provide "performance (near-native speed)," "sandboxing for security," "modularity (hot-swappable, versioned steps)," and "extensibility (new steps injected by modders)."
    Example: A Rust-based WASM orchestrator is shown, demonstrating how different stages (terrain, entity, transform, validate) are executed as WASM modules, receiving and returning JSON data.

C. Generic Templating System

This system provides "a flexible, reusable mechanism for defining entities, transformation steps, and content patterns in external configuration files."

    Templates: Defined in YAML/JSON, representing "entity archetypes (NPC, settlement, item, quest, event, etc.) and transformation step definitions." They support "inheritance" and "parameterized fields."
    Template Resolution: During generation, the engine fills parameters based on "constraints, random entropy, and world context."
    Extending Templates: New content or logic can be added by "defining new templates in external configuration files," registering "new transformation steps," and optionally adding "new hooks for inter-system communication."

III. Game Systems & Domain Modeling
A. DnD-Inspired Mechanics

    Character Sheets: Comprehensive stats, skills, abilities, spells, inventory, status effects.
    Dice Rolls: "All game mechanics (attacks, saves, skill checks) use deterministic dice roll systems."
    Skills/Spells/Abilities: "Modular, data-driven, and extensible (ScriptableObjects or JSON definitions)."
    Loot Tables: "Modular, weighted, and tiered based on procedural generation."
    Attack/Defense Rolls & Skill Checks/Saves: "Deterministic dice roll system for all combat," "fully data-driven."

B. Gameplay Systems

    Quest & Event Systems: Quest objects, objectives, rewards, "dynamic triggers, event-driven enrichment."
    Social/Guild System: Parties, guilds, alliances, relationships, reputation.

C. Entities & Components

The engine uses Unity's ECS model.

    Entities: "Players, NPCs, Enemies, Items, Spells, Abilities, Projectiles, Tiles, Rooms, Dungeons."
    Components: "StatBlock, Position, Velocity, Inventory, SkillSet, SpellBook, Health, Mana, StatusEffects, Faction, AIState."
    All entities except Characters/Enemies are Prefabs, loadable via Editor/Runtime.

IV. Scalability, Performance & Infrastructure

The engine is designed for high performance and global scalability for "hundreds of thousands to millions" of concurrent users.
A. Scalability Strategy

    Load Balancing: "Essential for scalability, high availability, performance, and elasticity." Strategies include Layer 4 (TCP/UDP), Layer 7 (HTTP/gRPC/WebSocket), and Geo-aware routing.
    Microservices: "Each game service... runs as an independent unit," offering "flexibility, modular scaling, language agnostic, easier upgrades." Tools: Docker, Kubernetes, gRPC.
    Event-Driven Architecture: "World events, player actions, and game ticks are published to an event bus" (Kafka, Redis Streams).
    CQRS + Sagas: Separates read/write operations for optimization.
    Sharding & Partitioning: "World split into logical/physical zones, each managed by its own backend instance (region server, DB shard)." This is a core concept, with "Each region... a logical grouping," having its "own pipeline execution" and "own state machine."

B. Infrastructure Stack

    Networking: Nginx, Envoy, Cloudflare, AWS ELB for load balancing, API Gateway (Envoy, Kong) for rate limiting and authentication, Service Mesh (Istio, Linkerd) for internal traffic.
